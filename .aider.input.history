+Using src/main.js and src/utils.js make a new way to select items out of a json array of objects. The json array of items will come from a remote source and you should show "loading" while the fetch happens. Each item in that object will have a name, short description, optional link to an icon, and a url to a git repo for downloading a game. The list could get long so when you press the "down" button to scroll though the list when you get to the bottom is should handle that in a graceful way (by scrolling down?).  You will need to use "createResourceLoader" in src/utils.js to preload a font and any items in the array. The font you will use is in public/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf.  This is a canvas only app. Only draw to the canvas like you see in the example. No css and no dom!

+okay, I had to move a few files around but that's really good! One bad thing is when the app starts, there is no loading screen. Also, we have to add the emoji font I added to public/fonts/NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf to get the arrows you used to work. And one TINY thing is that the directions to tell you to navigate up and down appear inside of an item instead of below it.
