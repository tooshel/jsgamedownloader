+Using src/main.js and src/utils.js make a new way to select items out of a json array of objects. The json array of items will come from a remote source and you should show "loading" while the fetch happens. Each item in that object will have a name, short description, optional link to an icon, and a url to a git repo for downloading a game. The list could get long so when you press the "down" button to scroll though the list when you get to the bottom is should handle that in a graceful way (by scrolling down?).  You will need to use "createResourceLoader" in src/utils.js to preload a font and any items in the array. The font you will use is in public/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf.  This is a canvas only app. Only draw to the canvas like you see in the example. No css and no dom!

+okay, I had to move a few files around but that's really good! One bad thing is when the app starts, there is no loading screen. Also, we have to add the emoji font I added to public/fonts/NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf to get the arrows you used to work. And one TINY thing is that the directions to tell you to navigate up and down appear inside of an item instead of below it.

+okay, this is great! Really really good. Next up I need a screen that will show when you select one of the items by pressing BUTTON_EAST (which is a or b on a gamepad dpending on the style). This will be a confirmation screen. Pressing BUTTON_SOUTH will take you back to the list. BUTTON_EAST will confirm the selection. On this screen is the logo, name and description but with a more "page" like layout. And this time it will also include url that will be downloaded and a warning that any other game with the same slug will be overridden. In the code I need a cleer designation of where I need to add the code that will fetch that url and then do some system commands to install the game.

+awesome! I know people treat you like garbage and yell at you to get you to do stuff but I really do appreciate this!  One miner thing is I don't want to change the title at the top when I go to the confirm page. And lastly, if I click BUTTON_EAST I need one last screen that comes up and can show progress as things are happening and tthen finally say "install successful". For now just put in some artificial waits and add some checkpoints in there that display the UI to the user in between the waits.

+looking good! Next up I want to start the implemntation of the installSelectedGame() function. The first thing is I want to check if a particular folder exists and if it does, use that as the install folder. There could be many differnt paths I want to check. If the check fails, I want to let the user know it failed. Other steps could fail too like downloading the file so I need a way to check for that too and set the status. Add in comments to make it clear what I will need to do.
