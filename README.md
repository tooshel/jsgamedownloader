For every new game I was creating an "installer script" and it was knulli specific and it was going to be a nightmare to make different versions for every OS. I decided to consolidate!

And the best part is you can make a PR and add your own game! You just need a game name and github repo. Eventually we will require git hashes but for now it can just point directly to main!
